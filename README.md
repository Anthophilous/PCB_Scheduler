# CS433 Programming Assignment 3

In this assignment, we will implement some basic scheduling algorithms discussed in the class. It is based on the programming project in chapter 5 of the textbook. 

How to Compile and Run the Program:

To compile the program, use command: make (fcfs / rr / sjf / priority)

To run the programs fcfs/sjf/priority, use command: ./(fcfs/sjf /priority) schedule.txt

To run the program rr, use command: ./rr schedule.txt [Integer representing Time Quantum]
